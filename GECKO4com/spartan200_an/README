Here the sources for the spartan 3 200AN FPGA are stored. To automatically
generate the bitfile you require that:
1) You have synplify_pro or synplify_premier_dp in your path and have a license
2) You have Xilinx ISE 11.x and up in your path with the required license

To generate the bitfile simply type: make xilinx_bit

A pre-generated bitfile can be found in the bitfile directory.
