The firmware of the GECKO4com consists of 2 parts:
1) The contents (bitfile) of the Spartan 3 200AN FPGA.
2) The firmware of the Cypres FX2.

To be able to use the GECKO4com you have to first program the Spartan 3 200AN
FPGA before you can "burn" the Cypress FX2 firmware.

To make the Cypress FX2 firmware you require SDCC.

To build simply type "make all". The firmware will be available when all went
well in the directory and is called firmware.hex.

To burn the firmware you require the fxload tool.

Execute:
fxload -v -t fx2 -D /dev/bus/usb/<path to the GECKO4main> \
-I firmware/firmware.hex -s firmware/firmware_upload.hex -c 0xC2

That's all, you should be ready to go.
